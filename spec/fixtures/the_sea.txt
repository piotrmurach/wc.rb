Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide
under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath
the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and
beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished
shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal
cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other,
carrying on eternal war since the world began.

Consider all this; and then turn to the green, gentle, and most docile
earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find
a strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular
Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of
the half-known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle,
thou canst never return!
